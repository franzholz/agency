Administrative Review
=====================


The extension may also be configured so that an email is sent to the site administrator when a visitor confirms his(her) registration.
In such case, the visitor is informed by email that his(her) registration needs to be reviewed and accepted by the site administration before he(she) may login.
The email sent to the site administrator contains all the information provided by the visitor (except the password). It also contains two links allowing the site administrator to accept or refuse the registration.
When the site administrator accepts or refuses the registration, an email is sent to inform the visitor of the decision of the site administration. The visitor may login only after the registration has been accepted by the site administrator.
The administrative review is bypassed when the registration was made by invitation.
