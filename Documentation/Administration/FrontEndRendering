HTML Template
=============

The default HTML template provided with the plugin is:
:file:`EXT:agency/template/agency_css_tmpl.html`

CSS Styles
==========

Default CSS styles are defined in TS template setup field of static template FE User Registration CSS-styled.
As usual, the default CSS styles may be modified and moved to a .css file. In such a case , the location of the file should be specified by an import rule overriding the default TS template setup:
:typoscript:`plugin.tx_agency._CSS_DEFAULT_STYLE = @import url("fileadmin/styles/some_style_sheet_file.css");` 

Alternatively, the selectors may be moved to some site-wide style sheet file and the default styles may be nullified:
:typoscript:`plugin.tx_agency._CSS_DEFAULT_STYLE >`
